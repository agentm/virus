# Virus: Rated E for Everyone

Mr. Hogwash had overpaid by $40 for his movie tickets. As a gold pass member, he was entitled to a hefty discount, especially since he had bought tickets to multiple movies which would effectively keep him in the theatre all day. As the junior member of the theatre's underpaid skeleton crew, I was relieved of my post ripping tickets and ordered to find Mr. Hogwash in theatre six and to offer him a wad of gift certificates as an apology.

I made my way to theatre six, entered the dark and over-air-conditioned theatre, and ripped my shoes with every sticky step to the front of the auditorium. I announced my presence with: "Mr. Hogwash? Is there a Mr. Hogwash here?" Almost instantly, I was met with simultaneous rebukes, "Shhhh! The movie started, moron!"

While movies start all the time in multiplexes, I felt that something about the timing was off since I had seen the marquee with the film starting at 10:00, but I had also glanced at my watch, as I often did to pass the time, and the time had been 10:10 just prior to entering the theater. Since the feature presentation was typically preceded by 30 minutes of advertising for local car dealers, the theater's barely hygienic, stale, yellowed popcorn, and other movies, I assumed that the projectionist had simply started the film early. The audience was settled and didn't seem to mind, so I made nothing of it.

In the meantime, a "Mr. Hogwash" lazily waved to me and I made my way through the aisle to speak to him. Luckily, he was seated next to the aisle so I didn't need to climb over any anyone while making the shoe-ripping sounds due to the corn-syrup-sticky floor. I was a bit taken aback not by Mr. Hogwash's clothing, which made him look like a cross between a college freshmen and a homeless man, but rather by his unorthodox smell. He smelled like concentrated movie seat odor, so it was quite obvious he was a frequent film-goer.

"Good morning, sir. As a gold member you are entitled to a 20% discount which the cashier mistakenly did not apply. We apologize and wish to offer you these gift certificates applicable for a future visit."

Mr. Hogwash grabbed the gift certificates and unthankfully exclaimed, "Whatever- now fuck off, the movie started."

I had become accustomed to such abuse in my short time as a ticket-ripper, but the second mention of the movie starting made me curious. Doesn't starting the movie early defeat the purpose of the theater? After all, a lot of advertising can be shown in 30 minutes to a captive audience. With my curiosity piqued, I finally turned to look at the screen. The movie had indeed started and was already past the 10 minutes of opening credits and overhead shots of Maine foliage!

Now more curious, I ripped my soles up to an aisle outside Mr. Hogwash's region-of-stink and took a seat. Certainly, if the projectionist had screwed up, I would want to observe and report it (and perhaps be offered his job for my vigilance).

The film's protagonist appeared to be a half-naked, red-haired, bearded man whom I had never seen before. That was curious because, as theater employees, we had free access to all the films outside of working hours and I had spent many of those free hours mindlessly snoozing through all the films the theatre was showing. In my experience, a theater was a great place for my farting experiments; it was easy to wait for an upcoming jump scare or otherwise noisy scene when I would release my gas and time how long it would take for nearby theater patrons to react.

Because I did not recognize the actor or the film, my curiosity intensified. What was that projectionist showing?!

The snippet of film I watched showed the bearded man in swimming trunks in the ocean alongside a concrete wall. The rusted hull of a boat framed him on the other side. He stuck his hands in the water and fished around for something unseen. Then, he pulled out two starfish, one in each hand, exclaiming, "Now I will write the funniest joke in the world!" He squeezed the starfish, which prompted them to squeeze unrealistic amounts of blue ink in all directions. The bearded man was sprayed with blue ink but laughed it off and pointed the starfish in the direction of the wall and squeezed more. Instantly, the wall was covered with some writing, but, at the camera's angle, it was difficult to read. The camera panned over to the wall to show the audience the text: "Party! Pool Party!" The theatre audience burst out in laughter and applauded.

At this, I really had to turn and look at the audience; they seemed fully engrossed. I could not, however, understand how the nonsense on the screen could entertain anyone, but I knew that the film selection was defective, so I headed out of the theatre while receiving dirty looks due to the shoe-ripping sounds, towards the projectionists' booth. As I approached the booth, I overheard the two projectionists arguing:

"Dude, the constitution is a list of rules the people need to follow. It's the law."

"No, dumbass, have you read any of it? It's a contract to restrict the government."

When they noticed me through their cubby hole to the real world, I received an annoyed look.

"Dude, you're not supposed to be back here."

"I know you're busy, guys, but I was just in theater 6 and the wrong movie is showing."

"Dude, don't tell me how to do my job."

"The movie is totally weird. Take a look."

Annoyed, one projectionist turned to a monitor, flipped to number six, and jerked his head back.

"Dude," he said addressing the second projectionist, "look at this shit."

From my vantage point, I could not see their monitor, but they were sufficiently confused that their eyebrows twisted. One projectionist hit a button.

"Ok, it's reset." Then, addressing me, "It's reset, so you can fuck off now."

"By the way," I foolishly followed-up, "Steve is right. The constitution is designed to restrict the government."

Both of them looked at me cock-eyed.

"Pfft, do you think we care what a newbie ticket-ripper thinks? FUCK OFF!" and he closed their cloth partition and continued yakking.

I made my way back to theater six. After all, the projectionists had merely reset the movie- I assumed it would be worth an announcement to the audience as to what had happened. As I approached the theater, a few angry-looking audience members pushed past me, complaining about how the movie was changed in the middle of the showing. Upon entering the theater, I knew we had a mutiny on our hands. People were throwing popcorn at the screen and yelling about returning to the movie. Upon resetting, the projectionist had mercifully skipped the 30 minutes of advertising, but the theater was now showing the intended movie- some throwaway summer romantic comedy starring who-the-hell-cares. The audience wanted to see the original movie with the starfish-wielding idiot!

I ripped my way to the front of the theater once again and tried to gain the audience's attention by waving my arms while fruitlessly cooking up an apology to calm them, when the screen went dark for a few seconds. I turned around and saw a giant logo, "Brought to you by: Chupacabra65". The film then started without credits or even a film title! I stared in disgust and wondered if the projectionist was pulling a prank- but on whom? The audience? The projectionists merely pushed play, why would they care about the audience?

I was frozen in place for a bit while trying to understand what was protocol for this situation when I suddenly realized I had read about this event in "Ticket-Ripper" magazine. Theaters around the world had had their films supplanted with movies randomly-stitched-together from the Internet using artificial intelligence. The computer virus was apparently written by nihilists a century beforehand as a proof-of-concept, but, more recently, an enterprising hacker had weaponized it. We had been hit by the "Junta.W32" virus!

The audience seemed oddly at-ease with the new film. They viewed the second film reset by the virus as an attempt to appease them and the remaining viewers had settled back in their seats. I didn't know what to say, so I sat down as well.

The film now showing appeared to be an amalgamation of multiple talk show hosts into one. I could recognize the hairpiece of one famous host with the plastic-rimmed glasses of another and the sallow-skinned, overconfident sexual predator demeanor of another. The audience didn't seem to notice or care that the third film they were seeing today was not the same as the first. Perhaps they viewed the whole series of mistakes as a spoof or perhaps they preferred not to think that movies can carry social commentary targeting themselves.

The talking head was ostensibly telling us the news, but, in reality, he was describing a pornographic encounter with a miniature horse! The description hit me like a load of bricks; if we shows something dumb, I thought that would blend in with the rest of our films, but if we showed something that would incense the censors, then we could be hit with fines!

I jumped up from my seat, but was immediately shushed, "Down in front!" I was silhouetted against the obscene film. Not wanting to upset the audience members, I instinctively sat down, frozen in indecision. Some of the audience members who had walked out when the rom-com had started were now walking back in angrily, but, when they saw the new, randomly-generated film, they became excited and sat down, exclaiming, "Ah- it's back!" How they recognized that a completely different film was the same as the first virus-generated film, I will never understand.

For the next forty minutes, I watched in awe as the audience laughed and cried at a film created by a million monkeys with typewriters. Writing down the plot of the film wouldn't make sense considering that it quite literally had none.

The film ended promptly at the scheduled time and without end credits or a satisfactory conclusion (what would it be?). The timed lights came on. The audience sat for a another minute without a word. I turned to see a sea of astonished faces. This film was unlike any they had seen before and, unbeknownst to them, unlike any film they would ever see again.

Mr. Hogwash was one of the first to jump up. He recognized me and brought his stench in my general direction.

"That. Was. Amazing! I have to see it again! When is the next showing?"

"Never," I quipped as I walked away.

Upon entering the lobby, a co-worker jumped down my throat.

"Where the hell have you been? I was covering for you for an hour!"

I simply ignored her and walked past, towards the exit, but a manager jumped in front of me.

"Simmons, were you watching a movie during work hours? You know that can get you fired, right?"

"That's fine," I said resignedly, returning the company-mandated bowtie. I had seen enough.

And that's why I don't go to movie theaters anymore.
